**2 自顶向上层次聚类方法 sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering**

- **ward** minimizes the variance of the clusters being merged.
- **average** uses the average of the distances of each observation of the two sets.
- **complete** or maximum linkage uses the maximum distances between all observations of the two sets.
- **single** uses the minimum of the distances between all observations of the two sets.
